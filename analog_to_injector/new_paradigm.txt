This is an attempt to introduce new paradigm.
Injectors work independently, being controlled by analog signal.
Each uC controls separate injector.
Injectors can overlap - there can be two uC's controlling two injectors 
both supplying LPG to the same cylinder.
Adjustment for staged injection profile in this case
is determined by modules pre injector driver, in analog domain.

Another approach would be to use separate mapping
table to map analog input to injector opening times
so in case of two uC's servicing same injector
both uC's would contain different tables to compensate 
for differences in injector profiles,
f.e. for small fuel rates 0-10%, only injector 1 would
operate in it's full range 
Range 10-100% would be covered by second, bigger injector.
